Classification of letters (Classify.java).

Write a method classify that, when given a char holding a letter of the alphabet, returns a String reporting whether the letter is uppercase or lowercase, and whether the letter is a vowel or a consonant, with a space inbetween. (Recall that a, e, i, o, and u are considered to be vowels, and all other letters are considered to be consonants.)
When classify is given a char that does not hold a letter of the alphabet, the empty string should be returned.

For example, classify( ‘E’ ) should return the String “uppercase vowel”.
