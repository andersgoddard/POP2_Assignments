Remove (Remove.java).

Write a method remove that takes in a single parameter, an ArrayList of Strings, and modifies the ArrayList by removing every other element in the list, starting from the 0-indexed element. If the given ArrayList is empty, then it should not be modified. (The method should not return anything.)

For example, if the method is given the ArrayList containing the Strings “Amelie”, “Beth”, “Chloe”, and “Delphine” (in that order), after the method terminates, the ArrayList should contain the Strings “Beth” and “Delphine” (in that order).
