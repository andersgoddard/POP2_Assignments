The odd between (Between.java).

Write a method between that, given two ints a and b, returns a String containing all odd ints that are strictly between a and b. In the returned String, the ints should be presented in ascending order if a <= b, and in descending order otherwise; consecutive ints should be separated by one space character. (Other than these, the returned String should not contain any other space characters.) If there are no odd ints satisfying the given description, then the empty String should be returned.

As examples, between( 3, 10 ) should return the String “5 7 9”, and between( 7, 1 ) should return the String “5 3”.
