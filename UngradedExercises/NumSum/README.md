Pair Programming Exercise: NumSum

* Write a program that takes as input a positive int, and prints the int as the sum 
of numbers each having one non-zero digit, ordered from largest to smallest

* For example, given 1024 as input, your program should print 

1000 + 20 + 4

* Note in the above example the zero digit in the hundreds place is ignored.

* Important: write your program WITHOUT using any types other than int. (You may 
use String expressions, but just for output). You should not declare any variables 
that are not of type int.

* This also means no methods with non-int return types, and no arrays, lists, or 
other collections
