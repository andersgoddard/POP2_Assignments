Triplicate (Triplicate.java).

In the provided file Triplicate.java, write a method triplicate that, given an instance of ArrayList<Integer>, modifies the ArrayList by adding, for each element, two extra copies of the element which are positioned next to the original element.

So, for example, given the ArrayList

[2,3,1],

the method should modify the list so that it is equal to

[2,2,2,3,3,3,1,1,1].
