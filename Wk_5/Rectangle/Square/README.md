Squares (Square.java).

After implementing the previous class, implement a class Square which extends the class Rectangle, and contains the following constructors, which should each be implemented by calling a constructor of Rectangle:

Square( int xLowerLeft, int yLowerLeft, int sideLength ) - This constructor should accept the coordinates of the lower left-hand corner of the square, along with the length of a side of the square.

Square( int sideLength ) - This constructor should accept the length of a side of the square whose lower left-hand corner is located at the origin, (0,0).
