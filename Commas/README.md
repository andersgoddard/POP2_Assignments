Separating by commas (Commas.java).

Write a method separate that, given a String, returns the String derived from the given one by inserting a comma character (‘,’) between each pair of consecutive characters. If the given String has length 0 or 1, then the method should return the given String, or one that is textually equivalent.

For example, separate( “Hello” ) should return the String “H,e,l,l,o”.
